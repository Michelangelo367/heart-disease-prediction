# Predicting heart disease

## Description

A machine learning model to classify if the patient is at risk of heart attack or not based on the given data of a patient.

## Lab Environment

Jupyter Notebook

## Domain 

Healthcare

## Tasks Done

A)	Data Analysis:  
    a.	Importing the dataset  
    b.	Getting information about dataset (mean, max, min, quartiles etc.)  
    c.	Finding the correlation between all fields.  

B)	Data Visualization:  
    a.	Visualizing the number of patients having a heart disease and not having a heart disease.  
    b.	Visualizing the age and weather patient has disease or not  
    c.	Visualizing correlation between all features using a heat map  
    
C)	Logistic Regression:  
    a.	Built a simple logistic regression model   
        i.	Divided the dataset in 70:30 ratio  
        ii.	Built the model on train set and predict the values on test set  
        iii. Built the confusion matrix and get the accu	racy score   

D)	Decision Tree:  
    a.	Built a decision tree model  
        i.	Divided the dataset in 70:30 ratio  
        ii.	Built the model on train set and predict the values on test set  
        iii.Built the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy  
        iv.	Visualizing the decision tree using the graphviz package  


E)	Random Forest:  
    a.	Built a Random Forest model  
        i.	Divided the dataset in 70:30 ratio  
        ii.	Built the model on train set and predict the values on test set  
        iii.Built the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy  
        iv.	Visualizing the model using the graphviz package  

F)	Selecting the best model:  
    a.	Printed the confusion matrix of all classifiers  
    b.	Printed the classification report of all classifiers  
    c.	Calculated Recall Precision and F1 score of all the models  
    d.	Visualized confusion matrix using heatmaps and Recall Precision and F1 score of all the models using bar graphs  
    e.	Selected the best model based on the best accuracies
